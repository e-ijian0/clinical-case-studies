# Acute Appendicitis in a Young Adult

## Patient Presentation

- **Age**: 22
- **Sex**: Male
- **Chief Complaint**: Right lower quadrant abdominal pain for 12 hours
- **Time of Onset**: Started as periumbilical discomfort, localized to RLQ over 6 hours
- **Setting**: Emergency department

## History of Present Illness

A 22-year-old male presents with abdominal pain that began 12 hours ago as a dull, cramping pain around the umbilicus. Over the next 6 hours, the pain migrated to the right lower quadrant and became sharper and constant. He reports anorexia and one episode of vomiting. He denies fever, diarrhea, or dysuria.

## Past Medical History

- **Chronic Conditions**: None
- **Surgeries**: Tonsillectomy age 6
- **Medications**: None
- **Allergies**: No known drug allergies
- **Social History**: Non-smoker, occasional alcohol, college student
- **Family History**: Non-contributory

## Physical Examination

- **Vital Signs**: T 38.2°C, BP 128/78, HR 102, RR 18, SpO2 98% on room air
- **General Appearance**: Anxious, lying still with knees flexed
- **HEENT**: Unremarkable
- **Neck**: Supple, no lymphadenopathy
- **Cardiovascular**: Tachycardic, regular rhythm, no murmurs
- **Pulmonary**: Clear to auscultation bilaterally
- **Abdomen**: Soft, tender to palpation in RLQ with guarding and rebound tenderness. Positive McBurney’s point tenderness. No masses or organomegaly.
- **Extremities**: Normal
- **Neurological**: Alert and oriented
- **Skin**: Warm, dry

## Differential Diagnosis

1. Acute appendicitis (most likely given migratory pain, fever, localized tenderness)
2. Mesenteric adenitis
3. Crohn’s disease flare
4. Right-sided diverticulitis (uncommon in young adult)
5. Testicular torsion (referred pain)

## Workup

### Laboratory Studies
- **Complete Blood Count**: WBC 14.5 ×10³/µL with 85% neutrophils
- **Basic Metabolic Panel**: Within normal limits
- **Inflammatory Markers**: CRP 32 mg/L
- **Urinalysis**: Normal, no pyuria or hematuria

### Imaging
- **CT abdomen/pelvis with IV contrast**: Findings consistent with acute appendicitis: dilated appendix (9 mm), wall thickening, periappendiceal fat stranding, no evidence of perforation.

## Final Diagnosis

**Acute uncomplicated appendicitis** confirmed by CT imaging and clinical presentation.

## Treatment Plan

- **Immediate Interventions**: NPO, intravenous fluids, analgesia (morphine), antibiotics (cefazolin + metronidazole)
- **Pharmacotherapy**: Preoperative antibiotics continued until surgery
- **Non‑pharmacologic Measures**: Laparoscopic appendectomy scheduled within 6 hours
- **Follow‑up and Monitoring**: Postoperative monitoring for signs of infection, discharge with oral antibiotics for 5 days, follow-up with surgeon in 2 weeks.

## Discussion

Acute appendicitis is a common surgical emergency. Classic presentation includes periumbilical pain migrating to RLQ, fever, leukocytosis. CT imaging is highly sensitive and specific. Early surgical intervention reduces risk of perforation and complications.
