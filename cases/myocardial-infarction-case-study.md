# ST‑Elevation Myocardial Infarction (STEMI) in a Middle‑Aged Male

## Patient Presentation

- **Age**: 58
- **Sex**: Male
- **Chief Complaint**: Crushing substernal chest pain radiating to left arm and jaw for 45 minutes
- **Time of Onset**: Sudden onset while watching television
- **Setting**: Emergency department via ambulance

## History of Present Illness

A 58-year-old male with no prior cardiac history experienced sudden onset of severe, pressure-like chest pain radiating to his left arm and jaw, associated with diaphoresis and shortness of breath. He rates pain 10/10. Symptoms started at rest and have not improved with nitroglycerin administered by EMS.

## Past Medical History

- **Chronic Conditions**: Hypertension (diagnosed 5 years ago, poorly controlled), hyperlipidemia
- **Surgeries**: None
- **Medications**: Lisinopril 10 mg daily, atorvastatin 20 mg daily
- **Allergies**: None
- **Social History**: 30 pack-year smoking history, occasional alcohol, sedentary occupation
- **Family History**: Father died of MI at age 62

## Physical Examination

- **Vital Signs**: T 37.0°C, BP 165/95, HR 112, RR 24, SpO2 92% on room air
- **General Appearance**: Anxious, diaphoretic, clutching chest
- **HEENT**: No jugular venous distension
- **Neck**: Carotid pulses symmetric, no bruits
- **Cardiovascular**: Tachycardic, regular rhythm, S4 gallop, no murmurs
- **Pulmonary**: Clear to auscultation, mild crackles at left base
- **Abdomen**: Soft, non-tender, no hepatomegaly
- **Extremities**: No edema, peripheral pulses present
- **Neurological**: Alert, oriented, no focal deficits
- **Skin**: Cool, clammy

## Differential Diagnosis

1. ST‑elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) – most likely given classic presentation, ECG changes
2. Unstable angina / NSTEMI
3. Aortic dissection (should be ruled out)
4. Pulmonary embolism
5. Pericarditis
6. Gastroesophageal reflux disease / musculoskeletal pain (less likely)

## Workup

### Laboratory Studies
- **Complete Blood Count**: Normal
- **Basic Metabolic Panel**: Mild hyperglycemia (glucose 148 mg/dL), otherwise normal
- **Cardiac Enzymes**: Initial troponin I 0.08 ng/mL (elevated), CK‑MB elevated
- **Lipid Profile**: LDL 145 mg/dL, HDL 35 mg/dL

### Imaging
- **ECG**: ST‑segment elevation in leads II, III, aVF with reciprocal changes in anterior leads, consistent with inferior wall STEMI.
- **Chest X‑Ray**: Mild cardiomegaly, no pulmonary edema or widened mediastinum.
- **Echocardiogram**: Hypokinesis of inferior wall, ejection fraction estimated 45%.

## Final Diagnosis

**Acute inferior wall ST‑elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI)** due to occlusion of right coronary artery.

## Treatment Plan

- **Immediate Interventions**: Aspirin 325 mg chewed, clopidogrel 600 mg loading dose, morphine for pain, supplemental oxygen, nitroglycerin sublingual
- **Pharmacotherapy**: Dual antiplatelet therapy (aspirin + clopidogrel), anticoagulation (heparin drip), beta‑blocker (metoprolol), statin (high‑intensity atorvastatin 80 mg), ACE inhibitor (lisinopril continued)
- **Non‑pharmacologic Measures**: Emergent cardiac catheterization with percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and stent placement to RCA
- **Follow‑up and Monitoring**: Cardiac rehabilitation, lifestyle modification (smoking cessation, diet, exercise), follow‑up with cardiology in 1 week.

## Discussion

STEMI is a time‑sensitive emergency requiring prompt reperfusion. Door‑to‑balloon time should be <90 minutes. Risk factors include hypertension, dyslipidemia, smoking, family history. Early PCI improves outcomes.
